  4. Over medium heat, mix with a spoon until it is all melted together- approx 2 minutes. It will resemble a thick caramel.
  5. take the carmel mixture and pour it over the oats and nuts. mix well with a spoon first, then with your hands If you need. Make sure every piece is saturated! 
  6. Put parchment paper down on a baking sheet then pour oats onto the sheet and evenly spread it out

  8. Put back in and bake for the remaining 11  mins. When it is done It should be golden not burnt!
  9. When it comes out, firmly press and pack it all down together with a spatula
  10. Let cool for 15 mins 
  11. It will be one big piece after it cools. Break it up in to any size clusters you want! 
  12. Finally add in the cranberries, coconut flakes, or dark chocolate bits and enjoy! 
notes:
- add dried fruit in after to prevent it from burning in the oven
- try making each batch with different toppings and see which combo you like the best

We make this recipe all the time since we eat it pretty much daily!
we will either snack on it, pouring it over a smoothie bowl, or even enjoy it as ceral with our favorite nut milk. Some may say we have a bit of a granola addiction...but after you taste it chances are you will too :)

Store bought granola is always overpriced, usually comes in small portions, and almost always in plastic bags. If you want to save some money, as well as say no to plastic, you're in the right place!
