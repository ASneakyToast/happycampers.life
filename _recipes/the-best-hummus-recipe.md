Hummus is just one of those foods that we can't imagine living without. We almost always have a fresh batch waiting for us in the fridge because it is quick and easy for  us to make an tastes amazing with lots of different dishes! It's a healthy an effortless snack that you can enjoy at anytime throughout the day. Just grab some baby carrots, pita chips, pretzels, or bread and dip in!

My love for hummus started around age 9 when I met my Palestinian best friend. Every single time I was over at their house (which was a lot) I would be served a bowl of her mom's freshly made hummus with a side of toasted pita bread. This recipe is my best recreation of their families secret recipe!

#### ways to eat
as a snack- drizzle with olive oil and then dip your favorite chopped veggies (like sliced bell pepper or carrots) or toasted sliced bread or pita bread. chips and pretzels also taste amazing with a little hummus!

On a sandwich on a vegan or veggie sandwich, hummus can be used to sub mayo or cheese!

As a side dish- pairs perfectly as a side of falafel, salad, or rice with veggies.
