  <h2>rv build / renovations</h2>
  <p>there's nothing more rewarding than living in a home that we build with our own hands. we renovated our rundown 1980 rv into a fully functional, off-grid, tiny-home without any prior experience. this was hands down one of the hardest things we've ever done, because we had no one to guide us through it all, here you can watch our renovation jouney unfold (and maybe learn a thing or two along the way!)</p>
