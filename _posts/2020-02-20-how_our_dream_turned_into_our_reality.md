It was new years, January 2020  when Joel and I met in beautiful, snowy Lake Tahoe at Snow Globe music festival. It really was love at first site<3

A few days after meeting one another, we sat down near a large window inside of a warm cabin and talked for hours. In front of us was a view of fresh falling snow and the pine trees that were towering over the cabin.

We shared stories about the places we’ve traveled to and our dreams of where we would love to vist in the future. There is still so much we want to see! 

During the converstaion, I brought up how amazing it must be to road trip across the United States with a camper van or RV. Joel’s eyes sparkled when I spoke about it. He told me, “ I’ve always wanted to do that.” 
“Really?” I replied to him, a little supried. “There aren’t many kids our age who do it. But, I really want to. And I’d like to do it sooner than later! I have an idea, just for fun, let’s look at some campers for sale online. I’m not even sure how much they are!” 
Joel smiled and said, “Let’s do it. I always wanted to take a gap year before college to trevel but I didn’t, maybe this is the time to do it. I could take this year off and once im back, finish my senior year of Art school. I would have time to practice my art and hobbies on the road and would be going back to school with a lot of new inspiration.”

It was starting to soud like this “crazy idea” might just work. 
And I was thinking to myself that i  met the most perfect person to do it with!  
We looked and looked at differnt  RVs, vans, and campers online.
So many different price ranges, styles, and sizes. 
We both would get excited when we found one that we loved. 
“THIS is the one!” we said to at least five different ones.
We both became so obsessed with the idea of living on the road that there was no way we would let go of this dream.

When we spoke to others about our idea, a fair share of them thought it was crazy… but do I blame them? The universe really does work in crazy ways, that’s for sure! 
They would say things like, “but you two just met!” Or, “Are you sure?” 
Well, the truth was, YES,  we were sure!  We could feel it in the deepest part of our beings. 

After we got home from Tahoe, we spent almost every day together. 
A few weeks later, we decided we wanted to live together until we were ready to hit the road once summer came around (at least we thought that was when we’d leave). 
We called a sweet little house in Oakland, Californa home.

Not too far from Joel’s school and my work at the time. 

We then again picked up the search for the perfect camper trailer. 
Day after day, we would message dozens of people with RVs for sale,  setting up times to visit. 
Many times they were scammes. Other times they’d cancel. Other times we would drive hours to look at a single camper but not be quite as in love as we thought.

Then one morning I woke up, turned to Joel, and said “I had a dream we found the perfect one.” I instantly got back to searching the internet for more “RVs for sale”. 
After only a few minutes of looking, I saw a camper that looked familiar. I shouted with excitment, “Like this! This is the one that was in my dream!” 
“Well let’s message them!” Joel replied. 

The sellers quickly replied and told us to come see it that same day. 
I remember us running to the car after realizing it was peak rush hour  traffic time. The sellers were at least and hour and a half away. 
We sat in traffic hoping there would still be daylight by the time we arrived so we could see the camper in clear view. 
The traffic magiacally cleared, and we got there in time! It seemed like the universe was really on our side with this one. 

We were greeted at their driveway. Friendly waves coming from an older couple. They turned out to be such loveley people. 
They gave us a full tour, inside and out and answered any questions we had.

They told us about how they recently purchased it from another seller and were so excited to road trip as a part of their retirement. Until the husbands surgery... he became ill and was now unable to live the RV lifestyle for the time being. 
He said, “I want to pass this on to people who would make good use out of her. She needs a little bit of work here and there but she will be a lot of fun. After messaging you folks earlier, I told my wife I had a good feeling about you two. We have lots of people who were interested and have sent in higher offers, but if you two really want it, we are more than happy to sell it to you.” 
Joel and I turned to each other smiling. “It’s perfect.” We said together.
The nice man even offered to hold it for us for 2 nights to let us sleep on the decision.
We took the offer because this was a pretty big decison after all.
But driving home, we couldn’t stop talking about how perfect she was. 
“I think we are finally done looking!”

The next morning we were (emotionally) ready to pick her up but at the time, didn’t have a towing vehicle to take her home with.
Oh and taking her home- that was another issue. We weren’t able to park an unattached camper on our street.

Reality was setting in, and these were two major issues we had to figure out. 

After a few phone calls, luckily, Joel’s dad offered to help us pick up the camper with his truck.
And for the parking situation, my grandma offered us the gated space at the side of her house. 

Now we were ready to go.

Anticipation and excitement filled us. “This is really it.” we thought as we were approching the sellers house. This was really our dream manifesting into reality. 
We arrived, and with a few helping hands she was hooked up to Joel’s dads truck.

We handed over a cash envelope of $3,500 and finished the transaction!
The lovely couple kept reminding us how happy they were that they were passing it over to us.

Then we were gone.

Off to drop it off at grandma’s. 
Once we got there we were hit with one of our first, of many, problems.
“It would have been a smart idea to measure the space before we got here.” I said as they tried to back up the camper into the side yard.
The space was so tighter than we thought- or the camper was bigger? We weren’t sure it was going to fit.

After a few hours, and a few more helping hands, it was finally in.

But this now became a tempirary solution. There was no way we would be able to open the door to get inside, let alone work on it like we needed to. 

After few days of figuring out what we were going to do now, there came the answer to our problem. A true saving grace. Joel’s parents came though, again! They have extra land up by there house in the Santa Cruz mountains and they offered to let us park the trailer there while we worked on it. 
We picked it up and moved it to the mountains.

“Now let’s get to work!” we said to each other.

Little did we know what that meant at the time and how much work actually needed to be done. 
We never would have guessed it would take 6 full months to renovate! 

It wasn’t always easy, but, it was worth every minute.
