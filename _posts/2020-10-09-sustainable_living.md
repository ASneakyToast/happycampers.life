"it is both our individual and collective responsibility to nuture and protect the earth we live on"

Sustainability, its far more than just a trendy buzz word that has recently been thrown around. Why does this word hold so much weight? Well, it is extremely important for a very straight forward reason: our life here on Earth depends on it!
 In the last few decades alone we have managed to steer far away from one of our fundimental reasons for existence, to live in harmony with nature! As a result, our planet is wounded, clearly communicating to us that it can't take much more of the distruction. When we recognize this reality, we rember that our mark here should not be one of descruction. Rather, that it is both our individual and collective responsibility to nurture and protect the earth we live on. But how can we go about that without knowing why and where to start? Let's dive in!

## What does it mean to live sustainably? 
Sustainable living describes a lifestyle that encourages people to reduce the demand of the earths natural resources. Minimalizing our personal and societal impact on our environment. In other words, reducing our "carbon foot print". 
You can actually see your current carbon foot print here using the [world wildlife funds environmental footprint calculator](www.thisismylink.com)

## Reasons why you should transition into a more sustainable lifestyle

While many may choose to ignore or deny it, the unfortunat truth is that due the way we are living, every other living system on the planet is on a fast decline.
And though I'm not here to write a novel about it, (this has been done by smarter and far more qualified experts) I want to recognize the importance of looking into the current condition of our planet, no matter how hard it may be to swallow. When we become aware of it, we are able to use it as a catalyst to jump start changes in our day to day life. 

With our never ending want for more "stuff" we are gobbling up the planets finite resources. Everything from the over use of fossil fuels, ongoing deforestation, to the demand of more single use items, and even the processed foods we eat. These habbits are just a few factors that play a role in the huge amounts of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere, global temperatures rising, extinction of millions of species, loss of fertile top soil, and  increased diseases like cancer, and depression. The list could go on and on.. but you get the point! They arnt things we want, for ourselves or for future generations. 

Let's now take a look at a few other complex ideas behind sustainable living, before we discuss where to start with the practical side of this lifestyle!

## What is the goal of sustainable living?

Everybody has the right to a healthy,  clean, and safe environment. No one in present day or in the future should be treated unfairly, no matter where they live. Not only do global environmental threats need to be reduced to protect human and environmental health, but also reducing economic eniquality and societal issues. For example, ruducing inflation and solving unemployment for a better economy . And for a healthy society, reducing poverty and homelessness, as well as creating health care for all, to name a few.

 Environmental protection, social equality, and economic development together create the ultimate goal of global sustainibility.

The three should live in harmony with one another, though today we find them often contradicting each other. But, we cannot have one without the other. And while what we are mainly discussing here today is environmental sustainibility, it is important to keep in mind that without societal and economic means, it is vulnurable to collapse. With that being said, of course there are descions being made in this world that our beyond our control, which is why the people we vote into government should be prioritize sustainibility. On the other hand, we as individuals must remember that we also have tremendous power in the way we choose to live.

Ruducing our impact on the plant and making eco friendly choices: sounds simple enough... right? 

The truth is, there is no "one size fits all" in sustainibility. It is a personal interpretation, and will be unique to your location and living conditions. However, there ARE many lifestyle tweaks and actions that together create a much more sustainable way of living.
