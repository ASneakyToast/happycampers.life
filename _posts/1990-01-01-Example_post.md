This is the excerpt text and also shows here on the leading page.

### This is a subheading.
And this is what the subheading is about. Its probably alot of stuff like yah dah dah, yeah ha ha, and also some more stuff.

Then there's a little ps kinda extra paragraph down here.

### Another subheading!
Yes another subheading, we can have as many as we want and the website will make a table of contents at the top of the page automatically. Although we havn't built that feature yet.

### More???
Not sure what other features we want yet but I know we'll need a photo gallery. Also I need to create a way we can easily choose photos for the main photo and other moments. Maybe I can make a naming convention format thing, where we can upload a photo called "year-month-day-photo--main" and it'll just use that. Although I want to be able to put the post md file and the photos within the same directory instead of organizing them file file type.
