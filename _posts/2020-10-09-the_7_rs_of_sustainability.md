"Quote" 

To sustain a healthy and livable planet, the time for change is now. We are destroying our planet, but that does not need to be the case. As we relearn to live in harmony with nature, we begin to take care of mother earth, our previdore of life. Our own future, as well as the future generations, will thank us for starting now. 
Heres are the key things to learn to help you kick off or improve your sustainable lifestyle! 

## Breaking the "cycle of stuff"

Everything we purchase starts with  harvesting the earths natural resources. Then, they get manufactured and produced to be turned in to goods. After, they are loaded on a ship and/or plane, then a truck to finally drop them off at a store to be distributed. With all that time, energy, and resources can you believe that was only the beginning? Once its at the store we get to go and purchase it. We use it a few times, then throw it out.

"The Cycle of Stuff" by Design Thinking

The reason why this cannot continue forever is because this cycle has a clear begging and end. But we only have one earth and limited resources, so breaking this cycle is necessary. We can do so by practing the easy to remember, 7 R's of Sustainibility!

## Learning the 7 R's of Sustainibility

Many of us have grown up learning (and probably reciting) the first big 3 "reduce, re-use, recycle" but have you been taught to do these things correctly? And did you know there is actually more to it than those? First I'll break down the 3 most common R's, then go into the ones you might not have heard of. 

## 1. Reduce (low waste + minimalism) 

![Photo of reduce]({% asset_path reduce.jpg %})

Because of the need to reduce pollution in the air, water and soil, there has been a huge movement in recent years of "low waste" or "zero waste living" to keep toxins and waste out of our oceans and landfills. 
And though "zero waste" may be unubtainable to some, low waste and reducing waste is something that everyone can practice.

When we say to throw something "away" we rarely think about what that means.  What really happens is that when your waste goes away, it will be on it's way into 1 of the 2,000+ landfills currently open in the US. Though you may never see one (they are often away from the public eye) what lay there are mountains of toxic materials that will never breakdown, constantly producing greenhouse gases and leachate.

Continuing to produce  more waste will lead to the need to build more landfills, built by clearing out natural ecosystems to make room for more toxic materials that will leech into the earths soil, with chemical runoffs going moving into our water supply. All of which are conserning threats to our environment. 

> Tip: When making any purchase, big or small, try asking yourself a few questions
> - "Do I really need this?"
> - "Could I get this item second hand instead" (thrift, Facebook marketplace, letgo)
> - "What perpous will this serve and for how long?"
> - "Can I buy this with less packaging somewhere else?" 

These will help you to think before you buy and become consious of how much waste you produce with a single purchase.

## 2. Reuse 


![Photo of reuse]({% asset_path reuse.jpg %})

There are many things that people consider to be a "single use" item, but in fact, most of these things can be reused multiple times before we send it off into the landfills!
Is it clean and still in good condition? Can it be washed to be reused? If so, use it again! 

Maybe you have some other item that has been sitting around the house, untouched for who knows how long. It could be clothes or kitchenwear for example, that you don't use anymore but are still in working condition. Chances are, someone else would love to use it! First, ask some friends if they might need it. If not, then donate it!  (Donation link)
Extend the life of your item, keeping it out of the landfills for longer! 

Tips: If you purchase food or drinks that come in a glass jar, when you're done you can save the jar, wash it, and fill it up again later with new food or drink that you want to store for longer! Wash and repeat this cycle. 

## 3. Recycle 

![Photo of recycle]({% asset_path recycle.jpg %})

Recycling requires us to first seporate our waste into categories. Each community has different guidelines on what can and cannot be recycled. (Click this link here to check your area) Then, at a recycle center, the process involves breaking (usually melting) the product down into it's basic raw material (plastic, glass, metal etc) then it's formed into new products. Recycling saves energy by making it possible for producers to not have to start over from scratch. Resulting in another way we are able to preserve our beautiful, natural resources. 

> Tip:
> - have serpate labled bins in your house for recycables, non-recycbles, and food watse so when the time comes for it to be taken everything is good to go! 
> -  don't contaminate the recycle bin! if there are non- recycables in the recycle bin, we contaminate loads of otherwise recycable materials that are now unable to be recycled. 
> - check if your recycables are clean! things cannot be recycled if they have food, liquid, or other waste inside 

## 4. Rot (composting food scraps) 

![Photo of compost]({% asset_path compost.jpg %})

Oh the magic of composting. It is the process where organic material such as yard trimmings and food scraps are broken down by microorganisms into a mineral dense fertilizer. It is then added to soil on to provide valuable nutriance and life! This help plants and food crops grow! It also reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and is something farmers refer to as "black gold". But due to the lack of this knowledge, every year there are 167 million tons of compostable materials are thrown into our landfills.  When we learn how to compost  (Learn what food scraps can and cannot be composted here) we are allowing nature to carry on it's natural cycle of decomposing, adding vital nutriance for not only the future plants but our future on this planet.

Tips: You can have a compost bin with a lid inside the house to collect scraps after cooking and eating (here) and/or a bigger turn bin (here) outside the house. Choosing to compost food items like veggies, fruits, and coffee grounds while excluding meats and dairy prevent insects and rodents from getting into your bin.  You can keep it to add to your own garden, have it picked up from your home, or donate it to compost collecters such as a community garden! 

## 5. Repurpose (upcycling) 

![Photo of repurpose]({% asset_path repurpose.jpg %})

You may be thinking, isn't repurposing the same as reusing? Actually, they significantly different! While reusing means to use something again for it's original purpose, repurposing requires some creativity to come up with a whole new way of using an item! When you repurpose something, it has the potential to last months, maybe even years longer than it's original purpose! Choosing this way saves energy because it didn't have to be taken to a faciility to be broken down and recycled. Instead, it's being upcycled into something you can now use, all while saving money!

Tips: To name a few, old clothes that can be cut up into washable rags to use instead of paper towels. And cans from canned food can be painted to your style and then be used as pots for your plants.  Thankfully, there are so many resources out there to help you gain inspiration for repurposing things. a few are (pintrest, etsy, tiktok). 

## 6. Repair (fix it, don't trash it!)

![Photo of repair]({% asset_path repair.jpg %})

Most of us have had something that we've thrown out just because at the moment we thought they were completely unusable or maybe even just too dirty.b Majoriry of the time all it takes is a little time or a bit of money for these things to be brought back to life! If it isn't a task that you want to take on yourself, check out (fixers collectives) that are now springing up in manh areas. 

Tip: Electronics, furniture, clothes, and appliances are all examples of things that can be repaired to be almost new again! Push back against disposable culture and over consumption. When we fix the things we already have rather than buying new ones, we save money and the planet! 

## 7. Refuse

![Photo of refusing]({% asset_path refusing.jpg %})

Refuse to buy or use items that are bad for the environment from the get go, so we don't have to go through the process of resusing or recycling at all! We make a point of not wanting or needing an item that is unsustainable. And once enough people do this, there is less of a demand for them, creating less production of that item. Saying "no" to single use items like produce bags, plastic straws, cups and cutlery, plastic shopping bags, and other items that come in a lot of packaging. 

Tip: Refusing a single use item is easy when you have on hand a reusable bag, reusable cutlery, and a reusable cup. 
Refusing to buy an item like non organic food for example, is easier when you know there is a healthier alternative for yourself and the earth. 

Those were the 7rs of sustainibility, if there could be one more I would add in there to make 8 it would be this one: 

## Raising awareness

As we know, education is a key tool in creating any kind of change. one can't  begin to change if one doesn't know the effects of their actions. We can take all we've learned to use our voices and our social media platforms to raise awareness of environmental issues. This is improtant so that people can keep these ideas in the forefront of their minds. By doing so, we can educate and encourage one another on protecting nature. 

Please share this to inspire others around you that they too can live a sustainable life.
